addition to the passive NFC Forum compliant contactless interface, the
IC features an I2C contact interface, which can communicate with i.MX7
if NTAG I2C is powered from an external power supply. An additional
externally powered SRAM mapped into the memory allows a fast data
transfer between the RF and I2C interfaces and vice versa, without the
write cycle limitations of the EEPROM memory.
